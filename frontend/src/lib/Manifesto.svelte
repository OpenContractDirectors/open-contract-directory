    When a dapp gets popular, people come to rely on it. But who controls that dapp? What are their
    incentives? Can they hike up fees? Can they implement geoblocking or censor addresses? Are they

    or sell user data?

    The Open Contract Directory (OCD) is a public goods repository of free, libre, ownerless,
    uncensorable dappsâ€”smart contracts and frontends you can trust. Public good means: no tokens, no
    upgradability, no hidden fees, no external interests!
